    question: `What is the key difference between kinematics and dynamics?`,
    options: [`Kinematics describes motion without reference to causes; dynamics studies forces and their effect on motion`, `Kinematics uses differential equations; dynamics uses algebraic equations`, `Kinematics requires numerical simulation; dynamics has closed-form solutions`, `Kinematics applies only to rigid bodies; dynamics applies to deformable bodies`],
    answer: 0,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `Think of kinematics as a movie script that just says "the ball goes here, then there" — no explanation needed. Dynamics is the physics engine that asks "WHY does it go there?" — what forces pushed it. Spline interpolation is kinematic: you just specify where things should be, not why they move there.`,
    explanation: `At [04:15], the lecturer states: "Dynamics is concerned with the study of forces and their effect on motion, as opposed to kinematics, which studies the motion of objects without reference to its causes." Spline/keyframe interpolation is a kinematic description because you specify positions without modeling the forces that would produce them.`,

    question: `Is spline/keyframe interpolation a dynamic or kinematic description of motion?`,
    options: [`Kinematic only for 2D scenes; dynamic for 3D scenes`, `Dynamic, because it requires solving differential equations`, `Kinematic, because it describes motion purely as spline curves without modeling forces`, `Dynamic, because it uses time derivatives to describe motion`],
    answer: 2,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: ``,
    explanation: `At [05:26], the lecturer explains: "We just said, oh, well, we want the motion to go here and then here and then here at these different moments in time... That's not a very dynamic description. We're not really understanding what forces would cause an object to move toward those points. So keyframe interpolation, spline interpolation is a kinematic description of motion."`,

    answer: 2,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `Just as the rendering equation is THE equation for light transport, F = ma is THE equation for animation. Everything else — Lagrangian mechanics, numerical integration schemes, particle systems — is just machinery to solve this one equation for different scenarios.`,
    explanation: `At [05:46], the lecturer says: "In rendering, we had the rendering equation. It's only natural that in computer animation, we have the animation equation. The animation equation is just F equals ma, right? Force equals mass times acceleration." This second-order differential equation governs all physically-based animation.`,

    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `Think of Q as one giant zip-file of the entire scene state. For 6 billiard balls in 2D, Q has 12 numbers (x,y for each ball). For a pendulum, Q is just the angle θ. Every problem maps to "where does this point travel in Q-space over time?"`,
    explanation: `At [07:18], the lecturer explains: "Any system has a configuration, Q, that's a function of time. And that configuration is just basically a big long list of all the variables that describe what the system looks like at the current moment in time."`,

    intuition: ``,
    explanation: `At [08:27], the lecturer explains: "There also will be typically some kind of constraints, something that says what rules must the objects obey at all time?

    options: [`It doubles the number of equations but halves the computation time`, `It makes numerical solution easier by expressing each update in terms of known quantities`, `It makes the equations analytically solvable for all systems`, `It eliminates the need for constraint handling in the simulation`],
    answer: 1,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `A second-order ODE says "I need two previous values to step forward." But a pair of first-order ODEs says "I only need the current value to step forward." This is exactly what numerical solvers need: given current state, compute next state. Introducing v = Q̇ as a separate variable converts "update Q using Q and Q̇" into two clean steps.`,
    explanation: `At [19:08], the lecturer explains: "We can split this up by introducing a new dummy variable for velocity. We can say Q dot is equal to V... Why do this? Mathematically, it's equivalent, right? We didn't really change what the equation means, but splitting things up this way will make it easy to talk about solving these kinds of equations numerically."`,

    answer: 3,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: ``,
    explanation: `At [20:01]–[22:29], the lecturer derives: "Q dot equals V and V dot equals g over m... The velocity V(t) = V₀ + t·g/m... Q(t) = Q₀ + t·V₀ + t²·g/(2m)." Since the force (gravity) is constant, acceleration is constant, velocity is linear in time, and position is quadratic.`,

    answer: 3,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: ``,
    explanation: `At [13:40], the lecturer defines: "The equation that we're interested in is the one that says the change in time of the positions of the generalized coordinates is just equal to some velocity function f evaluated for the current position, current velocities, and time." An ODE involves only time derivatives (no spatial derivatives), distinguishing it from a PDE.`,

    question: `For the scalar ODE u̇ = au, what is the exact solution and what does the sign of a determine?`,
    options: [`u(t) = u₀ + at; sign of a determines whether u grows or shrinks linearly`, `u(t) = Be^(at); a > 0 gives exponential growth, a < 0 gives exponential decay`, `u(t) = B/t; a determines the rate of hyperbolic decay`, `u(t) = B cos(at); a determines the oscillation frequency`],
    answer: 1,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `The derivative equals the function itself (up to a constant). What function IS its own derivative? The exponential. This is why e^x is so fundamental in physics — it's the natural solution to any system where growth rate is proportional to current size (bacteria, radioactive decay, charging capacitors, and many ODE approximations).`,
    explanation: `At [15:36]–[16:34], the lecturer states: "u(t) = Be^(at) is a solution to this differential equation." If a > 0, u grows exponentially; if a < 0, u decays toward zero. This is important: the exact same equation with different sign of a describes completely opposite behaviors.`,

    question: `Why is the pendulum harder to simulate than a ballistic trajectory (rock thrown through air)?`,

    answer: 2,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: ``,
    explanation: `At [23:19]–[24:02], the lecturer explains: "This is exactly the same as the problem we just looked at, the problem of throwing a rock through the air, except that now we've added a constraint... We now have a constraint that says the end of the pendulum has to sit on a unit circle." Adding even this simple constraint means no closed-form analytical solution exists.`,

    answer: 2,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `Instead of drawing force diagrams and reasoning about directions, you just write down two scalars: K (how fast things move) and U (how much potential energy is stored). No vectors, no coordinate system confusion. The Lagrangian L = K - U captures everything. The Euler-Lagrange equations then automatically crank out the equations of motion.`,
    explanation: `At [24:46]–[25:44], the lecturer says: "Write down the kinetic energy K... Write down the potential energy U...

    answer: 1,
    answerText: ``,
    intuition: `The left side d/dt(∂L/∂q̇) generalizes "mass × acceleration" — it's basically momentum (∂L/∂q̇) changing over time. The right side ∂L/∂q generalizes "force" — how much L changes when you shift position. So Euler-Lagrange is really just F = ma in disguise, but expressed through energies instead of vectors.`,
    explanation: `At [25:44], the lecturer states: "The dynamics are then given by the Euler-Lagrange equations, which say this: the time derivative of the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to velocity is equal to the derivative of Lagrangian with respect to the configuration." The left term becomes generalized mass×acceleration; the right becomes generalized force.`,

    intuition: `For u̇ = -au, Backward Euler gives u_{k+1} = u_k / (1 + τa). The factor 1/(1+τa) is always less than 1 for any τ > 0, a > 0 — so the sequence always decays. Compare to Forward Euler where the factor (1-τa) can exceed 1 and blow up. Implicit methods "look ahead" and self-correct, making them inherently more stable.`,
    explanation: `At [1:15:24]–[1:15:49], the lecturer derives: "U_{k+1} = 1/(1+τa) × u_k, which means after n steps, u_n = (1/(1+τa))^n × u₀... This is going to decay as long as 1 + τa > 1. Well, tau is a positive number, and A is a positive number, so this is always going to be true. What that means is backward Euler is unconditionally stable for linear ODEs."

that backward euler doesn't blow us but the drawback is we get damping. To solve damping , we can take more timestep but that is what we were trying to avoid in the first place. one way to solve it is simplectic euler.`,
